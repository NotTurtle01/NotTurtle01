### Hi there 👋

I'm NotTurtle01 and this is my Profile!
<!--
**NotTurtle01/NotTurtle01** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting the university degree 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: AI and machine learning
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate: on almost everything (at least theoretically)
- 📫 How to reach me: you have several links to my social media (Twitter, GitHub and my WebSite)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm kind of new on programming, but eager to learn more!
