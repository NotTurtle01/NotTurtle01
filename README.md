### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm NotTurtle01 and this is my Profile!
<!--
**NotTurtle01/NotTurtle01** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: getting the University Calification (4-year degree).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: AI and Machine Learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate: on almost everything (at least theoretically).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you have several links to my social media (Twitter, GitHub and my WebSite).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm kind of new on programming, but eager to learn more!
